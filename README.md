*Note it may seem like the notes are going past and in turn failing, but in the videos you can see and hear the audio queues which show they get clicked perfectly.

**Some Frequently asked questions and answers:**

- Q: Does this work for bingo/iron man/stranded..?
> A: Yep! You can use this on any profile!

- Q: Can I get the "Harp Master" Emblem with this Mod?
> A: Yes! As well as the "Harp Note" Emblem.

- Q: What is Tickless Mode? And is it safe to use?
> A: Tickless Mode simply removes the redundant delay Minecraft introduces when clicking inside of a GUI. In turn, you can do the harp regardless of your ping to the server. Tickless Mode is entirely safe to use as it does not exploit anything that may go against the network's rules.

- Q: What ping is this for?
> A: Any ping! If you have low ping but are simply struggling with the harp, you can use this mod as well!

- Q: Is this safe to use?
> A: Yes! This simply clicks in a manner you reguarly would, meaning it looks the exact same as human input for the Network.

- Q: It keeps failing, what do I do?
> A: Disconnect for about 5 minutes; this will give time for your Skyblock island to refresh, which increases performanceâ€”something crucial for the harp. If you are using it in the park, you may simply switch to another lobby. With the new Tickless mode, the only factor for failing would be the server! You should always be able to do any song regardless of your ping or location.

- Q: Do I need the harp on my island?
> A: Nope, but it performs better.

- Q: Does this support every ping? What ping did you use?
> A: Yes, with this update, I've included a ping slider as well as the new Tickless Mode, which ignores ping! I used this mod on about 250ms ping with no issues.

- Q: What songs are supported?
> A: Every song! Including the difficult ones such as Through the Campfire, Pachelbel, etc. Using Auto Mode will automatically select the song for you!
